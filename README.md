## ðŸ§ª Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Design and implement **ABX testing** for multiple versions of marketing emails.
- Statistically analyze the effectiveness of different email versions.
- Understand hypothesis testing in a multi-variant setting.
- Help data teams make **data-driven decisions** in email marketing strategies.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Components

### âœ… Hypothesis Notes
- Introduces the core concepts of hypothesis testing.
- Covers types of errors, null vs. alternative hypotheses, and test selection.

### ðŸ§  ABX Experimentation Notebook
- Loads and preprocesses email campaign data.
- Conducts ABX testing using appropriate statistical methods.
- Visualizes performance metrics across different email variants.

### ðŸ“Š Dataset
- `email_campaign_data.csv` contains synthetic or anonymized real-world data for testing email performance.
- Common columns may include: `email_id`, `variant`, `open_rate`, `click_rate`, `conversion`, etc.

### ðŸ“˜ Data Science Guide
- Provides best practices for designing experiments.
- Discusses when and how to use A/B vs. ABX testing.
- Includes references to statistical tests and assumptions.
